# Nested JSON Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of nested JSON support in BrokoliSQL-Go, highlighting what has been implemented and what could be improved in the future.

## Implemented Features

### Core Features

1. **Automatic Schema Inference with Nesting Support** ✅
   - Detects nested objects within JSON and generates separate SQL tables
   - Establishes foreign key relationships between parent and nested tables
   - Maintains topological order of table creation and insertion

2. **Primary Key and Foreign Key Generation** ✅
   - Assigns auto-increment primary keys to each table
   - Generates foreign keys in child tables referencing parent IDs
   - Ensures referential integrity with proper SQL constraints (including ON DELETE CASCADE)

3. **Multi-level Nesting Support** ✅
   - Handles deep nested structures recursively
   - Normalizes nested objects into separate tables with proper relationships

4. **Type Inference Engine** ✅
   - Infers SQL column types based on JSON values
   - Handles nested objects and arrays appropriately

5. **Insertion Order and Dependency Resolution** ✅
   - Inserts data respecting dependencies between tables
   - Avoids foreign key violations by resolving parent inserts before children

### Robustness and Safety Features

6. **Escaping and Sanitization** ✅
   - Properly escapes strings to avoid SQL injection
   - Ensures generated SQL is syntactically valid

7. **Null and Missing Field Handling** ✅
   - Optional fields default to NULL in SQL
   - Columns are nullable by default

8. **Consistent Naming Conventions** ✅
   - Supports snake_case, camelCase, and PascalCase naming conventions
   - Quotes identifiers to avoid SQL reserved keyword conflicts
   - Generates meaningful table and column names from JSON keys

### Extensibility and Configurability

9. **Support for Multiple SQL Dialects** ✅
   - Uses the existing dialect system for SQL generation
   - Works with all supported dialects (Generic, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle)

10. **Array Handling Strategies** ✅
    - Stores primitive arrays as JSON/TEXT
    - Normalizes arrays of objects into child tables with foreign keys

11. **Custom Schema Overrides** ❌
    - Not implemented in this version

12. **Batch and Streaming Modes** ✅
    - Uses the existing batch processing system for INSERT statements

## Future Improvements

### Advanced Features to Consider

1. **Reversible Mappings**
   - Enable round-trip transformation (SQL → JSON) for validation and bi-directional workflows

2. **Dependency Graph Visualization**
   - Generate visual ER diagrams or dependency graphs from the schema

3. **Template System for Output**
   - Add customizable SQL templates for better control over statement formatting

4. **Schema Metadata Output**
   - Output schema metadata as JSON/YAML for external integration

5. **Enhanced Array Handling**
   - Add support for many-to-many relationships
   - Allow configuration of array handling strategies

6. **Custom Schema Overrides**
   - Allow users to provide schema hints or override automatic type inference

7. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize memory usage for large datasets
   - Add streaming support for very large JSON files

## Example Use Case

The implementation successfully handles the example use case from the instructions:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "address": {
    "city": "Maputo",
    "geo": {
      "lat": "-25.9",
      "lng": "32.6"
    }
  }
}
```

It correctly:
- Creates `geo`, `address`, and `users` tables
- Links `address.geo_id → geo.id` and `users.address_id → address.id`
- Respects insertion order: `geo → address → users`

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses all the core requirements for nested JSON support and many of the robustness and extensibility features. It provides a solid foundation that can be extended with more advanced features in the future.
