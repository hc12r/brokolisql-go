# GitHub Actions Implementation for BrokoliSQL-Go

This document provides a summary of the GitHub Actions implementation for the BrokoliSQL-Go project.

## Overview

GitHub Actions has been implemented to automate various aspects of the development workflow, including:

1. Continuous Integration (CI)
2. Code Quality Checks
3. Cross-Platform Testing
4. Release Automation
5. Dependency Management
6. Security Scanning

## Implemented Workflows

### 1. Tests Workflow (`tests.yml`)

This workflow runs the test suite and generates code coverage reports.

- **Triggers**: Runs on pushes to `main` branch and on pull requests
- **Key Features**: 
  - Runs all tests with verbose output
  - Generates code coverage reports
  - Uploads coverage data to Codecov

### 2. Code Quality Workflow (`code-quality.yml`)

This workflow checks code quality using linters and formatters.

- **Triggers**: Runs on pushes to `main` branch and on pull requests
- **Key Features**:
  - Runs golangci-lint to check for code issues
  - Verifies that all code is properly formatted with gofmt

### 3. Cross-Platform Testing Workflow (`cross-platform.yml`)

This workflow ensures the code works across different operating systems and Go versions.

- **Triggers**: Runs on pushes to `main` branch and on pull requests
- **Key Features**:
  - Tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
  - Tests with Go 1.24+

### 4. Release Automation Workflow (`release.yml`)

This workflow automates the release process when a new version is tagged.

- **Triggers**: Runs when a tag starting with 'v' is pushed (e.g., v1.0.0)
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses GoReleaser to build binaries for multiple platforms
  - Creates a GitHub Release with the built binaries
  - Generates release notes

### 5. Dependency Updates Workflow (`dependencies.yml`)

This workflow keeps dependencies up-to-date.

- **Triggers**: Runs weekly on Mondays and can be manually triggered
- **Key Features**:
  - Updates all Go dependencies to their latest versions
  - Creates a pull request with the updates

### 6. Security Scan Workflow (`security.yml`)

This workflow scans the code for security vulnerabilities.

- **Triggers**: Runs on pushes to `main` branch, on pull requests, and weekly on Sundays
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses Gosec to scan for security issues in the code
  - Uses govulncheck to check for vulnerabilities in the code
  - Uses Nancy to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## Configuration Files

- **`.github/workflows/`**: Directory containing all workflow YAML files
- **`.goreleaser.yml`**: Configuration for GoReleaser used in the release workflow

## How to Use

Detailed instructions on how to use and customize these workflows are provided in the [GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS.md) file.

## Benefits

The implemented GitHub Actions provide the following benefits:

1. **Automated Testing**: Ensures code changes don't break existing functionality
2. **Code Quality Assurance**: Maintains consistent code style and quality
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Verifies the tool works on all supported platforms
4. **Streamlined Releases**: Simplifies the release process
5. **Up-to-date Dependencies**: Keeps the project secure and current
6. **Security Awareness**: Identifies potential security issues early

## Next Steps

To further enhance the CI/CD pipeline, consider:

1. Adding code coverage requirements (e.g., minimum coverage percentage)
2. Implementing performance benchmarking
3. Setting up automated documentation generation
4. Adding integration tests with actual databases
5. Implementing deployment to package managers (e.g., Homebrew)
